# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

-Created a JS file, so that the HTML doucment wouldn't get out of hand with all the code being added. 

-Current day is displayed at the top of the calender
I went with the full date, year, and timer format. When working with a planner you want this information. Even if this is meant to be a work day planner, being able to quickly confirm the date is a helpful feature to have.

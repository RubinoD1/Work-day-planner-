# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

#General Notes
- Created a JS file, so that the HTML doucment wouldn't get out of hand with all the code being added.
- I didn't like the Font Awesome save icons. So, I decided to use a button labeled "Save" instead of replacing the default button. 
- I used Bootstap for the adjustable break points that media query would normally do in the CSS, "row, col-sm , col-md, col-lg", etc.  


-Current day is displayed at the top of the calender
I went with the full date, year, and time format. When working with a planner you to be able to quickly confirm all of this information.
